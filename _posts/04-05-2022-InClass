-Need to add authentication line now (think phishing - you do not want to delete other accounts, etc)
> "cross-site request forgery"
- <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>">

- now should use a[1] instead of a.at(1) for accessing arrays
- it's the same for ActiveRecord_Relation (.at will not work there)


- .find_by will find the record and take the first value out ie. @the_movie = Movie.find_by({ :id => the_id })
