> Creating our own journal

My journal is based off of [Jelani's](https://jelani.dev/)

Here are the notes from Raghu:
- First, you need to become comfortable with Markdown. This is a simplified markup language, much easier to write than HTML, that developers use constantly; particular, we’ll be using it all quarter to discuss code on GitHub.
- Next, use the appdev-projects/til repo (Links to an external site.) as a template and create your own copy on your own GitHub account. This will form the basis of your blog, although you can customize it later.
- -After it’s copied, find the file _config.yml, edit it (you can edit right in GitHub's web interface), and update Line 5 to be "https://your-username.github.io". (If you named your copy of the repo anything other than "til", then edit the "baseurl" field to match the repo name.)
- Also update the Author section on Line 11.
- > Commit your changes to _config.yml.
- Click on the Settings tab of the repository, then scroll down to find the Pages tab.
Find the “Source” dropdown, select the main branch, and save. It will say "Your site is ready to be published at....".
- Refresh the settings page after ~1 minute, and that message should change to "Your site is published at...." Your blog is online at https://your-username.github.io/til/!
- Go back to the repository and find the _posts/ folder, then find the file inside called ...-three-things-i-learned-from-the-ruby-koans.md. Write some Markdown in there and then commit the changes.
