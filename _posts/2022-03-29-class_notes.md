# Day 1 In-Class Notes
- reminder on how to create new base rails: https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/851


**RESTful routing** = standardized convention for route naming (ie. post, get, etc), verb will indicate what CRUD operation is happening
- get = index
- post = create
- patch = update
- delete = delete

>can delete all routes and do resource declarations --  resources(:movies)
still need to do controller and those actions, etc.
